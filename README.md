UHECR analyzer
==============

This is a collection of tools to distribute calculations for UHECR propagation on a cluster and to collect and analyze the output.

These tools were developed for and used mainly in [Heinze et al., Astrophys.J. 873 (2019)](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab05ce)

Software requirements
---------------------

The majority of the code consists of pure Python modules.

Dependencies (list might be incomplete):

- python-3.7 or later (The legacy python 2.7 version is retained as a branches/Py2_legacy)
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- iminuit
- jupyter notebook or jupyter lab (optional, but needed for the example)
